OPEN THE MANUAL ACTIONS REPORT

 



What is a manual action?
Google issues a manual action against a site when a human reviewer at Google has determined that pages on the site are not compliant with Google's spam policies. Most manual actions address attempts to manipulate our search index. Most issues reported here will result in pages or sites being ranked lower or omitted from search results without any visual indication to the user.

If your site is affected by a manual action, we will notify you in the Manual Actions report and in the Search Console message center.

Why do manual actions exist?

Ever since there have been search engines, there have been people dedicated to tricking their way to the top of the results page. This is bad for searchers because more relevant pages get buried under irrelevant results, and it's bad for legitimate websites because these sites become harder to find. For these reasons, we've been working since the earliest days of Google to fight spammers, helping people find the answers they're looking for, and helping legitimate websites get traffic from search.

Google is constantly working to improve search. We take a data-driven approach and employ analysts, researchers, and statisticians to evaluate search quality on a full-time basis. Changes to our algorithms undergo extensive quality evaluation before being released. More information about our algorithm.

Our algorithms are extremely good at detecting spam, and in most cases we automatically discover it and remove it from our search results. However, to protect the quality of our index, we're also willing to take manual action to remove spam from our search results.

Do I have any manual actions against my site?
You'll see a count of manual actions against your site at the top of the report. If your site has no manual actions, you'll see a green check mark and an appropriate message.

But I just bought this site!

If you recently bought a site that violated our spam policies before you owned it, fix the issues listed in this report, then let us know in your reconsideration request that you recently acquired the site and that it now no longer violates the policies.

What pages are affected?
Expand the manual action description to see a list of patterns of affected pages. This can be a subset of your site, or the entire site. Not all of the pages matching the pattern are necessarily affected.

Example:

https://example.com/real-estate/* – some or all pages under the real-estate/ directory are affected.
Affects all pages – Manual actions with this description affect the entire site.
How do I fix the problem?
To fix a manual action on your site:

Expand the manual action description panel on the report for more information.
See which pages are affected.
See the type and short description of the issue, and follow the "Learn more" link to see detailed information and steps to fix the issue. (You can find the detailed information for each action below on this page).
Fix the issue on all affected pages. Fixing the issue on just some pages will not earn you a partial return to search results. If you have multiple manual actions on your site, read about and fix all of them.
Be sure that Google can reach your pages; affected pages should not require a login, be behind a paywall, or be blocked by robots.txt or a noindex directive. You can test accessibility by using the URL Inspection tool.
When all issues listed in the report are fixed in all pages, select Request Review in this report. In your reconsideration request, describe your fixes. A good request does three things:
Explains the exact quality issue on your site.
Describes the steps you've taken to fix the issue.
Documents the outcome of your efforts.
Reconsideration reviews can take some time (see below). You will be informed of progress by email. You will get a review confirmation message when you send your request, to inform you that the review is in progress; don't resubmit your request before you get a final decision on your outstanding request.


How long will my reconsideration review take?
Most reconsideration reviews can take several days or weeks, although in some cases, such as link-related reconsideration requests, it may take longer than usual to review your request. You will be informed by email when we receive your request, so you'll know it is active. You will also receive an email when the review is complete. Please don't resubmit your request before you get a decision on any outstanding requests.

Doorways
Next, follow the steps below to identify and correct the violation(s) on your site:

Check for content on your site that duplicates content found elsewhere.
Check for thin content pages with affiliate links on your site.
Check for doorway pages on your site.
If your site contains any of these types of content, think about whether your site provides significant added value for your users. 
Tip: Consider asking friends or family — real people not affiliated with your site — to use or critique your site to get ideas for improving it.
Improve your website so that it provides significant value for your users.
When you're sure that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, select Request Review on the Manual Actions report. Provide examples of bad content that you removed and good content that you added.
After you've submitted a reconsideration request, be patient and watch for review status messages in your Search Console account — we'll let you know when we've reviewed your site. If we determine that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, we'll revoke the manual action.

What's the difference between the Manual Actions report and the Security Issues report?
There is some conceptual overlap between the Manual Actions report and the Security Issues report, so it is useful to know the difference between them:

The Manual Actions report lists manually detected issues with a page or site that are mostly attempts to manipulate our search index, but are not necessarily dangerous for users. Most issues reported here will result in pages or site being ranked lower or omitted from search results without any visual indication to the user.

The Security Issues report lists indications that your site was hacked, or behavior on your site that could potentially harm a visitor or their computer: for example, phishing attacks or installing malware or unwanted software on the user's computer. These pages can appear with a warning label in search results, or a browser can display an interstitial warning page when a user tries to visit them.
